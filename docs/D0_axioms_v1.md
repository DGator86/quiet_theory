\# D0 Axioms v1 (QuIET)



\## A0 — Substrate

There exists a finite N (toy) or countably infinite (idealized) set of information sites i.

Each site has Hilbert space H\_i ≅ C^{d\_i}. The total space is H = ⊗\_i H\_i.



\## A1 — Global Purity (Unitary Substrate)

D0 is described by a single normalized pure state |Ψ⟩ ∈ H with no intrinsic time parameter.



\## A2 — Pregeometry

D0 contains no metric, manifold, or adjacency relations as primitives.

Any “connectivity” must be derived from correlations in |Ψ⟩.



\## A3 — Maximal Entanglement Constraint (Toy Version)

For fixed N and uniform local dimension d, D0 satisfies an AME constraint:

For any subset A with |A| ≤ floor(N/2),

ρ\_A = Tr\_{A^c}(|Ψ⟩⟨Ψ|) = I / d^{|A|}.



\## A4 — Derived Correlation Graph

Define mutual information I(i:j) from reduced states.

The weighted complete graph with weights w\_ij = I(i:j) is a derived object, not fundamental.



\## A5 — No Internal Measurement

D0 contains no measurement events; “collapse” is not part of D0.

Any later measurement-like process must emerge in D2→D3 via interactions/constraints.



\## A6 — Admissible Deviations (Future Hook)

A “defect” is any local or structured violation of A3 that preserves A1 initially.

D1 will be defined as dynamics of defect nucleation + propagation.
